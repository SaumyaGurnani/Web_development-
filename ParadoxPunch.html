    <h2>A paradox? What does that mean?</h2>
    <p>A statement that is <strong>seemingly contradictory</strong> or opposed to common sense and yet is perhaps
        true.It can be considered a statement which is true and false at the same time.The underlying meaning of a paradox is to arrest attention and provoke fresh thought.Paradoxes help us understand reality better.They are counter intutive.</p>
    <p>Any human's reaction after so much theory...</p>

    <ul>
        <li><br> <img src="This-is-a-paradox.png" alt="paradox image" width="600" length="600"></li>
        <li>A paradox exists when someone says, "This statement is a lie" or "This statement is false," because if it were true, the statement would be stating the truth. However, if the statement is accurate, it would reject the claim that it is a lie. The fact that this statement conflicts with itself shows that it can be both true and false.</li>

            <h3>Literary Examples</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Shakespeare's Hamlet-"I must be cruel to be kind"</li>
                <li>In George Orwell's Animal Farm-"All animals are created equal,but some are more equal than others"
                </li>
            </ol>

    <h3>Now let's try to solve the troll's paradox riddle</h3>
    <p>You've discovered a doorway to another realm, and now you and your brother are off exploring the wonderful world of Paradoxica. Fantastically paradoxical creatures crawl, run, and fly around you.

    <p>And then you see the troll. It's catching all the creatures in an enormous net. You bravely step forward and demand it let them go.</p>

    <p> The troll laughs “If you're such a fan of paradoxes,” it says, “then I'll make you an offer. If you say something true, I'll release all these creatures.”
    </p>
    <p>You're about to say, “You are a troll,” but before you can, the troll grabs your brother. “If you say something
        false,” he continues, “then I'll release your brother. Your statement can only be a single sentence. And as you
        can see, I hate paradoxes more than anything. If you try to cheat by saying something paradoxical, like, 'this
        statement is false',then I'll eat your brother and the creatures.”
        <strong>What statement can you say to free your brother and other creatures as well.</strong>
